Encryption of Image Using Triple DES 
In todayâ€™s world almost all digital services like internet communication, medical 
and military imaging systems, multimedia system needs a high level security. 
There is a need for security level in order to safely store and transmit digital 
images containing critical information. This is because of the faster growth in 
multimedia technology, internet and cell phones. Therefore there is a need for 
image encryption techniques in order to hide images from such attacks. In this 
system we use Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard) in order to hide image. 
Such Encryption technique helps to avoid intrusion attacks.
